Draft commit message with LLM

## Introduction
Smart-committer is for people who are still write code nowadays. This simple
tool will send the staged changes to LLM to generate a piece of nice commit
message to describe the changes, and allow further editing before submitting.

Everything is configurable with the TOML config file at 
```
$HOME/.config/smart-committer/config.toml
```

Only `git` is supported now. More VCS supports are coming soon.
